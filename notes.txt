servlet --- controller -- backend 
view --- html 


signup.html-->SignupController[request,response]-->view.html

jsp --> java server pages | java servlet pages

jsp --> view + java [ html + java ] 

jsp -> directly htlm | ??->java 
signup.jsp --> signupcontroller -->get  [setdataforjsp , jump to Display.jsp ]  

1 scriptlet  <% %>   { used to write any java code } 
2 declaration <%!  %> { used to declare variable }*
3 expression  <%=  %> { used to print any variable } 

JSP ---> it has 9 implicit objects



-------------------------------------

to create servlet we used HttpServlet class 

	Servlet - interface 
	
	GenericServlet - class 
	
	HttpServlet - class 
			service  -- we are not suppose to override this method 
					 -- *doGet *doPost doDelete doHead doTrace   
			
   jsp -> form [method-get] --> submit -> request -->server --> servlet --> doGet() 
   jsp -> form [method-post] --> submit -> request -->server --> servlet --> doPost()
   
   service method will call with any http method  
   
    as per tomcat's specification its advisable that we are not allow to override service method 
  	why?
  	service method is override by tomcat it self 
  	-> http method get --> doGet 
  	-> http method post --> doPost 
  	
  	
  	if you have data which is concern with user's security / privacy  -- then u need to use  http post method [ from -- post ] 
  	
  	
  	HTTP :- 
  		REST 
  		
  	GET		user/:id	READ/single   
  	POST	user		INSERT 
  	PUT		user		UPDATE 
  	DELETE	user 		DELETE 
  	GET		user		READ / all records 
	GET		users  		READ / all records 
		
-------------------------------------------


interface A{
	void add();
	void sub();
}
abstract class Aimpl implements A{
	public void add(){}
}
------------------
marker interface 
functional interface

SERVLET LIFECYCLE 

init() -- called once -- explicit allocation
service() -- called every time 
destroy()  -- called once 


server -- first request --servlet ---

search memory class load?? servlet class? No 

1)load class 
2)create instance [ thread ]
3)init 
4)service 

second request 
search memory class load?? servlet class? Yes 
service() 

500 request there is only 1 object to server  for those 500 request 

if 500 request are submited to server then 1 object of servlet is created and 500 threads are created for service/work/process 

CGI vs Servlet 

500 request -> 500 object [ CGI ]  --> 

create -- release 

When you shutdown your server 

5) destroy  -- [ object -- explicit init -- release ]  



 1) load class
 2) create instance 
 3) init()
 4) service()
 5) destroy

Dao --> query

TASK:
	Signup
	Login
	Logout
	ListAllUsers 
---------------------------------------



add 1  more field for user , roleId 
we have two role in app 1) user 2) admin 
using roleId we can identify user role.

when user login u need to check role of the user 
if user is admin then redirect user to the admin dashboard.
admin can delete and update user.

if user is user then redirect user to his home page and display his name with 
welcome message. 
user can modify his own profile. he cant delete or update any user. 

logout can jump to login page 


1) how admin and user role identify ?
	when any one signup then default role is user. 
	first admin will create by manually. and next admin can created using admin dashboard.  
2) if user have user role then he/she never access any page of admin
